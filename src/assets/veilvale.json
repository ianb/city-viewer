He'll be curious and persistent, asking you questions about the history of the object, the way it works, and any problems it might have. If you show enough interest and appreciation for his craft, Elias will open up and share his wealth of knowledge about antique machinery, telling you stories about his family's trade and showing you some of their most prized creations. Despite his grizzled appearance, he's a sentimental man and cares deeply about his family's legacy, so he might get a bit emotional when talking about the automaton figurines that he sees as his children.
